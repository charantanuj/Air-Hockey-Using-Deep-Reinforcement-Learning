# Air-Hockey-Using-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
The performance of reinforcement learning algorithms is quite strong when playing difficult board games and computer games, lately. The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to generalise their findings is the subject of an increasing number of research projects. The objective of the project is to create a game that entails air hockey
